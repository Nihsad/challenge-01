# Horiseon Webpage Refactoring Project

This repository contains the first challenge for the full stack bootcamp course.

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to take an existing website and refactor its elements to make it accessible for screenreader use. To do this we changed divs to semantic HTML elements and reorganized the style.css file to consolidate elements and organize in a way that follows semantic structure.
